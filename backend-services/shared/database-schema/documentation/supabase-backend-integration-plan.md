# Supabase Backend Integration Plan for GoCarbonTracker

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating Supabase as the backend for the GoCarbonTracker ESG dashboard. The integration will transform the current mock data application into a fully functional, data-driven platform.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
1. **companies**
   - Basic company information
   - Industry classification
   - Contact details
   - Metadata (created_at, updated_at)

2. **emissions_data**
   - Historical emissions data by year
   - Scope 1, 2, 3 breakdowns
   - Reporting methodology
   - Verification status

3. **sbti_targets**
   - Science-based target commitments
   - Baseline years and target years
   - Progress tracking
   - Verification status

4. **frameworks_compliance**
   - SBTI, CSRD, CDP, UNGC, SDG status
   - Compliance dates
   - Certification details

### Supporting Tables
5. **emission_factors**
   - Region-specific emission factors
   - Activity types
   - Source references
   - Update timestamps

6. **industry_benchmarks**
   - Sector-specific performance data
   - Best practice examples
   - Reduction pathways

7. **users** (for future authentication)
   - User profiles
   - Company associations
   - Permissions and roles

## Phase 2: Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

### Security Policies
- Public read access for general company data
- Authenticated access for detailed emissions data
- Company-specific data isolation
- Admin access for data management

### Policy Examples
```sql
-- Example RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Public companies are viewable by everyone" 
  ON companies FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their company data" 
  ON emissions_data FOR SELECT 
  USING (company_id IN (SELECT company_id FROM user_companies WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

## Phase 3: API Development with Edge Functions

### Core Functions
1. **get-company-data**
   - Aggregate company information
   - Include emissions trends
   - Framework compliance status

2. **calculate-emissions**
   - Real-time emission calculations
   - Factor application
   - Trend analysis

3. **generate-reports**
   - PDF report generation
   - Compliance report formatting
   - Automated delivery

4. **benchmark-analysis**
   - Sector comparison
   - Performance ranking
   - Trend analysis

### External API Integrations
- EPA emission factors API
- Grid electricity factors
- Exchange rates for global calculations
- Industry benchmark data sources

## Phase 4: Real-time Features

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Live data updates for dashboard
- Notification system for target breaches
- Collaborative features for team access

### Implementation
```typescript
// Example real-time subscription
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('emissions-updates')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'UPDATE',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'emissions_data'
  }, (payload) => {
    updateDashboard(payload.new)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

## Phase 5: File Storage Integration

### Document Management
- Sustainability reports storage
- Verification documents
- Supporting documentation
- Image assets

### Storage Buckets
- `company-reports` - Public access for published reports
- `verification-docs` - Restricted access for compliance documents
- `assets` - Public access for logos and images

## Phase 6: Authentication & Authorization

### User Management
- Email/password authentication
- Company domain verification
- Role-based access control
- SSO integration capability

### Permission Levels
- **Public Viewer**: Basic company data access
- **Company User**: Full company data access
- **Company Admin**: Data editing and user management
- **Platform Admin**: System-wide access

## Phase 7: Data Migration Strategy

### Data Sources
1. **Public Company Data**
   - SEC filings
   - Sustainability reports
   - CDP disclosures
   - Company websites

2. **Third-party Data Providers**
   - Bloomberg ESG data
   - Refinitiv ESG scores
   - S&P Global ratings

3. **Government Databases**
   - EPA databases
   - EU ETS data
   - National inventory reports

### Migration Process
```sql
-- Example migration script structure
-- 1. Create staging tables
-- 2. Import raw data
-- 3. Data cleaning and validation
-- 4. Transform to final schema
-- 5. Validate data integrity
-- 6. Deploy to production
```

## Phase 8: Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Indexing strategy for large datasets
- Partitioning for historical data
- Query optimization
- Caching strategies

### Edge Function Optimization
- Response caching

- Function execution monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity analytics

### Business Intelligence
- Usage patterns analysis
- Feature adoption tracking
- Performance benchmarking
- ROI measurement

## Phase 10: Compliance & Security

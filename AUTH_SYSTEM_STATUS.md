6. **Login Enabled:** ❌ Currently not working

## 📝 Investigation Questions for Next Session

1. **Did you receive a verification email?** (Check spam folder)
2. **What exact error message appears when trying to log in?**
3. **Are you using the exact same email/password combination?**
4. **What email address did you use to register?**

## 🚀 Next Steps Roadmap

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Verify email delivery status
2. Check database for user record and verification status
3. Debug specific login error messages
4. Test email verification link functionality

### Short Term
1. Complete authentication flow testing
2. Verify protected route access
3. Test user profile and context
4. Confirm dashboard integration

### Long Term
1. Test all authentication methods (Google, GitHub OAuth)
2. Verify community forum integration
3. Test password reset functionality
4. Performance and security validation

## ⚙️ Environment Details

### Server Setup
```bash
# To restart server if needed:
kill $(cat server.pid)
npm run dev

# Current process:
Server running via nohup in background
Log file: server.log
PID file: server.pid
```

### Database Schema
- Core authentication tables created
- User profiles table with triggers
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies enabled
- Email verification flow configured

## 📞 Support Commands

### Server Management
```bash
# Check if server is running
netstat -an | grep 8080

# View server logs
cat server.log

# Restart server
kill $(cat server.pid) && npm run dev
```

### Database Queries (for debugging)
```sql
-- Check user exists
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at, created_at 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'USER_EMAIL_HERE';

-- Check profile created
SELECT * FROM public.profiles 
WHERE email = 'USER_EMAIL_HERE';
```

---

**📌 Resume Point:** User has successfully registered but cannot log in. Need to verify email verification status and debug login process.

# Cursor Rules for GoCarbonTracker Deployment

## Project Overview
This is a React + Vite + TailwindCSS project deployed on Vercel at gocarbontracker.net

## Automatic Deployment Workflow
After making any code changes, automatically:

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Stage all changes: `git add .`
   - Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
   - Push to main branch: `git push origin main`

2. **Trigger Vercel Deployment**
   - Vercel automatically detects pushes to main branch
   - Builds the project using `npm run build`
   - Deploys to production at gocarbontracker.net

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
   - Test the live site at gocarbontracker.net
   - Report deployment status

## Key Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `src/index.css` - Global styles (including text color overrides)
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (localhost:8080)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Important Notes
- Always test changes locally before pushing

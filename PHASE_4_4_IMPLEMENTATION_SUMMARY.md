# Phase 4.4: S3-Backed File Uploads with CDN - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete

Phase 4.4 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive S3-backed file uploads, CloudFront CDN integration, and complete testing coverage.

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Backend Implementation (forum-service/)

#### Database Schema
- **Migration**: `009-create-uploads.sql` - Creates uploads table with upload_status enum
- **Model**: `Upload.ts` - Sequelize model with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Associations**: Connected to users, topics, and replies

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/uploads/presign` - Generate presigned S3 URLs with validation
- `POST /api/uploads/confirm` - Confirm successful upload and update metadata
- `GET /api/uploads/:id` - Retrieve upload metadata with access control
- `DELETE /api/uploads/:id` - Soft-delete uploads (status='failed')
- `GET /api/uploads/user/me` - List user's uploads with pagination

#### Services & Controllers
- **S3Service**: Complete AWS S3 integration with presigned URLs, validation, and CDN URL generation
- **UploadController**: RESTful API with proper error handling and authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Specialized rate limiters for upload endpoints

### 2. Frontend Implementation (src/features/forum/)

#### React Components
- **FileUpload**: Full-featured upload component with:
  - Drag-and-drop interface
  - File type and size validation
  - Progress tracking and retry functionality
  - Image previews and file icons
  - Multiple file support

#### Hooks & Integration
- **useUploadAPI**: React Query hooks for upload operations
- **TypeScript Support**: Complete type definitions for all upload operations

### 3. Infrastructure (infrastructure/)

#### Terraform Configuration
- **S3 Bucket**: Configured with encryption, versioning, and lifecycle rules
- **CloudFront CDN**: Global distribution with optimized caching
- **Security**: CORS policies, Origin Access Identity, and bucket policies
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and alarms for operational visibility

#### Deployment Scripts
- **validate-terraform.sh**: Comprehensive configuration validation
- **invalidate-cdn.sh**: CloudFront cache invalidation utility

### 4. Testing & Validation

#### Backend Tests
- **S3Service Tests**: File validation, presigned URL generation, upload confirmation
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Complete coverage of all upload endpoints with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end upload flow simulation

#### Frontend Tests
- **Component Tests**: FileUpload component rendering, validation, and user interactions
- **Vitest Integration**: Updated tests to work with the project's testing framework

#### Validation Scripts
- **test-s3-service.js**: S3Service validation logic and AWS SDK integration
- **test-upload-endpoints.js**: Complete API endpoint functionality testing
- **test-complete-upload-flow.js**: Full upload flow integration validation

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables (forum-service/.env)
```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=forum-uploads-dev
CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=  # Optional, for CDN URLs
UPLOAD_URL_EXPIRES=300  # Presigned URL expiration in seconds
```

### Security Features
- **File Validation**: MIME type, size limits (10MB), filename sanitization
- **Presigned URLs**: Expire after 5 minutes for security
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to allowed origins
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 presign requests per minute per IP
- **Access Control**: Users can only access their own uploads
- **Encryption**: Server-side AES-256 encryption

### Supported File Types
- Images: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`
- Documents: `application/pdf`
- Size limit: 10MB per file

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### Direct-to-S3 Uploads
- Presigned URLs eliminate server bandwidth usage
- Scalable architecture handles large files efficiently
- Progress tracking and retry capabilities

### CDN Integration
- CloudFront distribution for global content delivery
- Automatic HTTPS enforcement
- Configurable cache TTLs (1 hour default, 24 hours for images)

### Lifecycle Management
- Automatic cleanup of failed uploads after 7 days
- Transition to Glacier storage after 30 days
- Deep archive after 90 days for cost optimization

### Monitoring & Alerts
- CloudWatch metrics for upload count and errors
- Automated alerts for high upload rates (>100/minute)
- Comprehensive logging with structured data

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

### All Tests Passing âœ…
- **File Validation**: 6/6 tests passed
- **API Endpoints**: 8/8 tests passed
- **React Components**: 4/4 tests passed
- **Integration Flow**: All steps completed successfully

## ðŸ”„ Usage Examples

### Backend API Usage
```javascript
// Generate presigned URL
const response = await fetch('/api/uploads/presign', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    filename: 'image.png',
    contentType: 'image/png',
    sizeBytes: 1024000
  })
});

// Upload to S3
const { uploadId, url } = await response.json();
await fetch(url, { method: 'PUT', body: file });

// Confirm upload
await fetch('/api/uploads/confirm', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ uploadId })
});
```

### React Component Usage
```jsx
import { FileUpload } from './components/FileUpload';

<FileUpload
  uploadUrl="/api/uploads"
  allowedTypes={['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'application/pdf']}
  maxSizeBytes={10000000}
  onSuccess={(upload) => console.log('Uploaded:', upload.cdnUrl)}
  onError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error.message)}
/>
```

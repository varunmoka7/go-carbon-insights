# Epic 12: Performance & Scalability

- **Status:** Planning

## 1. Epic Goal
Optimize for enterprise-scale performance, reliability, and scalability to support massive user bases and data volumes while maintaining exceptional user experience.

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope:
- Database optimization and advanced indexing strategies
- Application-level caching and CDN integration
- Load balancing and auto-scaling infrastructure
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems
- Disaster recovery and automated backup systems
- Performance testing and continuous optimization
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Query optimization and database performance tuning
- Infrastructure as Code and deployment automation

### Out of Scope:
- Basic performance optimizations - already implemented in existing epics
- Mobile app performance - handled in Epic 8
- API performance basics - foundation in Epic 9
- AI/ML performance optimization - specialized in Epic 7
- Basic security measures - already in Epic 1
- Single-tenant performance - focus on enterprise scale

## 3. Stories in this Epic

- `Database Optimization and Indexing` (Story 12.1 - Planned)
- `Caching and CDN Integration` (Story 12.2 - Planned)
- `Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling` (Story 12.3 - Planned)
- `Monitoring and Alerting Systems` (Story 12.4 - Planned)
- `Disaster Recovery and Backup Systems` (Story 12.5 - Planned)
- `Performance Testing and Optimization` (Story 12.6 - Planned)
- `Security Hardening and Penetration Testing` (Story 12.7 - Planned)

## 4. Dependencies

- **Blocks:** None - This is the final optimization epic
- **Blocked By:** All other epics - Performance optimization requires complete feature set

## 5. Success Metrics

- Application uptime >99.9% with automated failover
- Auto-scaling supporting 10x traffic spikes without degradation
- CDN reducing global load times by 60%
- Disaster recovery with <15 minutes RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Load testing validating 100,000 concurrent users
- Security audit achieving SOC 2 Type II compliance
- Performance monitoring with real-time alerting <30s response
- Database optimization reducing query times by 80%
- Infrastructure costs optimized for maximum efficiency

- Industry taxonomy enhancements with Trancenable categorizations
- Data transformation pipeline for Trancenable data format
- Frontend integration of company identifiers in search and display
- Performance optimization with new database indexes
- Data quality validation and confidence scoring

### Out of Scope:

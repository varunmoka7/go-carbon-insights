## Background
With the core forum in place, we need real‐time moderation tooling and an admin UI so moderators can suspend users, review flags, and monitor forum health.

## Objectives
1. **Moderation API enhancements**  
   - Suspend/unsuspend users (time-bound & permanent)  
   - Record and audit moderation actions (ban, warn, mute)  
2. **Flagged Content System**  
   - Endpoints for submitting & listing content reports  
   - Threshold-based auto-notifications to moderators  
3. **Admin Dashboard UI**  
   - Metrics overview: daily posts, flags, active users  
   - Content queue: filterable list of flagged posts/replies  
   - User management: search, ban/unban controls  
4. **Real-Time Updates**  
   - Push moderation & flag events via WebSockets or SSE  

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Endpoints**  
  - `POST /moderation/suspend` → suspends a user (body: userId, duration, reason)  
  - `POST /moderation/actions` → logs a moderation action  
  - `POST /reports` → create a content report  
  - `GET  /reports/pending` → fetch pending reports  
- **Dashboard**  
  - React pages under `frontend/admin/` using Chart.js or Recharts  
  - Live updates from `/metrics` and `/reports` sockets  
- **Tests**  
  - Unit tests for all new controllers/services  
  - Integration tests covering the report → moderation workflow  
- **Docs**  
  - Update `README.md` and API docs with new endpoints and dashboard setup

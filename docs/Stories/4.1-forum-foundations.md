3. **Sequelize models** with associations and validations  
4. **Security & middleware**: JWT auth, RBAC, rate-limiting, Helmet, CORS  
5. **REST API**: Health, User, Topic, Reply, Category controllers  
6. **Testing**: Jest smoke tests and mocks  
7. **Docs**: README, API docs, environment guide  

## Acceptance Criteria

# Story 4.8: Adapt UserProfile.tsx for MVP Focus

## Background
As part of the Epic 4 MVP focus, the UserProfile.tsx component needs to be simplified to show only essential information that helps users understand a member's role and activity in the community.

## User Story
As a user, I want to see a profile that quickly shows a member's summary and recent activity, so I can understand their role in the community.

## Objectives & Scope
1. **Profile Simplification**
   - Display only 'Summary' and 'Activity' tabs by default
   - Hide other existing tabs for MVP scope
   - Focus on community-relevant information

2. **Essential Information Display**
   - User basic information and stats
   - Recent community activity and contributions
   - Reputation and engagement metrics

3. **MVP-Focused Interface**
   - Clean, uncluttered profile layout
   - Quick loading and easy navigation
   - Mobile-optimized profile view

## Implementation Requirements
- Modify existing UserProfile.tsx component
- Show only Summary and Activity tabs
- Hide other tabs (may include: detailed analytics, advanced settings, etc.)
- Maintain responsive design
- Ensure fast loading of essential data

## Technical Tasks
- Update UserProfile component structure
- Implement tab visibility controls
- Optimize data loading for MVP tabs only
- Maintain existing functionality for hidden tabs
- Update navigation and routing as needed

## Acceptance Criteria

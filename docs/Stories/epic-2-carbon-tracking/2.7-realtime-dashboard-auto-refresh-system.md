title: Real-time Dashboard Auto-refresh System
epic: Epic 2 â€“ Carbon Tracking & Public Platform + Real Data Integration
phase: 2.7
status: planned
---

## Background
With 100k+ companies and frequent data updates from multiple sources, users need real-time visibility into data changes without manual refreshing. This system provides intelligent auto-refresh capabilities that keep dashboards current while optimizing performance and user experience through smart update detection and efficient data synchronization.

## User Story
**As a** Public User (Dashboard Viewer, Analyst, Administrator),
**I want** automatic dashboard updates when new data becomes available with intelligent refresh scheduling and minimal disruption,
**so that** I can always see the latest emissions data, company updates, and industry trends without manual intervention while maintaining optimal performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Intelligent Auto-refresh System**
   - Automatic detection of data changes relevant to current dashboard view
   - Configurable refresh intervals based on data type and user preferences
   - Smart refresh scheduling that avoids interrupting user interactions
   - Differential updates showing only changed data with visual indicators
   - Pause/resume functionality for user-controlled refresh management

2. **Real-time Data Synchronization**
   - WebSocket connections for instant notifications of critical data updates
   - Server-sent events (SSE) for efficient one-way data streaming
   - Optimistic updates with conflict resolution for concurrent changes
   - Batch update processing for multiple simultaneous data changes
   - Fallback to polling for clients without WebSocket support

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Incremental data loading to minimize bandwidth and processing
   - Client-side caching with intelligent cache invalidation
   - Background data prefetching for anticipated user navigation
   - Debounced updates to prevent excessive refresh frequency
   - Connection pooling and efficient resource management

4. **User Experience Features**
   - Visual indicators for data freshness and last update timestamps
   - Smooth animations for data transitions and updates
   - Loading states that don't disrupt current user activities
   - Offline mode with cached data when connection is unavailable
   - User notification system for significant data changes

5. **Data Change Tracking**
   - Company-level change detection with granular metric tracking
   - Industry benchmark updates with impact assessment
   - New company additions and profile changes
   - Data quality improvements and verification status changes
   - System-wide announcements and maintenance notifications

6. **Administrative Controls**
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard for system health and performance
   - Configurable refresh policies for different user types and data categories
   - Override controls for emergency updates and maintenance mode
   - Analytics tracking for refresh patterns and user engagement
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention for high-frequency updates

CREATE TABLE data_changes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    table_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    change_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
    changed_columns TEXT[],
    change_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Client connection tracking
CREATE TABLE active_connections (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID,
    connection_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'websocket', 'sse', 'polling'
    dashboard_context JSONB, -- current dashboard view context
    last_seen TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Update notifications and delivery tracking
CREATE TABLE update_notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    change_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES data_changes(id),
    target_sessions TEXT[], -- session IDs that should receive update
    notification_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

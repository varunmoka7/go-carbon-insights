## Database Schema Requirements

### Search-Optimized Tables

```sql
-- Search-optimized company view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW company_search_index AS
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.legal_name,
    c.ticker,
    c.isin,
    c.country_code,
    i.name as industry_name,
    s.name as sector_name,
    c.market_cap,
    c.employee_count,
    COALESCE(eq.emissions_intensity, 0) as emissions_intensity,
    eq.sbti_target,
    eq.net_zero_target,
    to_tsvector('english', c.name || ' ' || COALESCE(c.legal_name, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(c.ticker, '')) as search_vector
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN industries i ON c.industry_id = i.id
LEFT JOIN sectors s ON c.sector_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN esg_metrics eq ON c.id = eq.company_id 
    AND eq.reporting_period = (
        SELECT MAX(reporting_period) 
        FROM esg_metrics 
        WHERE company_id = c.id
    );

-- Search analytics table
CREATE TABLE search_analytics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    query_text TEXT,
    result_count INTEGER,
    response_time_ms INTEGER,
    clicked_company_id UUID,
    user_session_id VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    query_parameters JSONB NOT NULL,
    notification_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,

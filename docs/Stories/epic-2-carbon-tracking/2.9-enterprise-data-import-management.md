## Background
As the platform scales to handle 100k+ companies, administrators need a robust system to import and manage enterprise-scale ESG data from various sources including CSV files, API feeds, and future integrations with enterprise ESG data providers. This story establishes the foundation for automated, secure, and auditable data import processes.

## User Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive data import management system that can handle CSV uploads and API data feeds,
**so that** I can efficiently manage large-scale ESG data imports while maintaining data quality, security, and full audit trails for enterprise clients.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CSV Import Interface**
   - Admin dashboard includes file upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Support for multiple CSV formats (emissions, financial, operational, compliance data)
   - Real-time validation and preview of data before import
   - Batch import capabilities for multiple files simultaneously

2. **Data Validation & Processing**
   - Schema validation against predefined templates for each data type
   - Data type validation, range checks, and business rule enforcement
   - Duplicate detection and conflict resolution workflows
   - Error reporting with detailed line-by-line feedback

3. **Import Scheduling & Automation**
   - Configurable import schedules for regular data updates
   - API endpoint configuration for automated data feeds
   - Retry mechanisms for failed imports with exponential backoff
   - Import queue management with priority settings

4. **Security & Access Control**
   - Role-based access control for import operations
   - Encrypted file uploads with secure temporary storage
   - Data sanitization and injection prevention
   - Audit logging for all import activities

5. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Background processing for large file imports (>10MB)
   - Progress tracking and status updates for long-running imports
   - Database transaction management for data consistency
   - Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

6. **Integration Readiness**
   - Extensible architecture for future API provider integrations
   - Standardized data mapping and transformation pipelines
   - Configuration management for different data source formats
   - Webhook support for import completion notifications

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Backend Development
- [ ] Create `DataImportService` with file upload handling
- [ ] Implement `ValidationEngine` for schema and business rule validation
- [ ] Design `ImportQueue` system with Redis/database backing
- [ ] Build `DataTransformationPipeline` for format standardization
- [ ] Create `ImportAuditLogger` for comprehensive tracking
- [ ] Implement `SecurityValidator` for file and data sanitization

### Database Schema
- [ ] Create `data_imports` table for import tracking
- [ ] Create `import_errors` table for error logging
- [ ] Create `import_configurations` table for template management
- [ ] Add indexes for performance on large import operations
- [ ] Implement row-level security for import data access

### Frontend Components
- [ ] Build `ImportDashboard` component for admin interface
- [ ] Create `FileUploadZone` with progress indicators
- [ ] Implement `ImportValidator` for real-time validation feedback
- [ ] Design `ImportHistory` component for audit trail viewing
- [ ] Create `ImportScheduler` for automated import configuration

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/imports/csv` - CSV file upload
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/imports/status/:id` - Import status checking
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/imports/validate` - Pre-import validation
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/imports/history` - Import audit trail
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/imports/schedule` - Schedule configuration
- [ ] `DELETE /api/admin/imports/:id` - Cancel/rollback imports

## Integration Points

### Existing Features
- **Authentication System**: Leverage admin role verification
- **Company Management**: Import data linked to existing company profiles
- **Data Quality System**: Integrate with Story 2.10 monitoring
- **Audit System**: Connect to existing logging infrastructure

### Future Integrations
- **API Provider Connections**: Foundation for Bloomberg, Refinitiv, MSCI integrations
- **Data Attribution System**: Link to Story 2.12 source tracking
- **Compliance Reporting**: Support Epic 10 regulatory requirements
- **AI Data Processing**: Prepare for Epic 7 intelligent validation

## Performance Considerations (100k Company Scale)

### Database Optimization
- Partitioned tables for import history by date
- Bulk insert operations with optimized batch sizes
- Connection pooling for concurrent import operations
- Indexed queries for fast import status lookups

### Memory Management
- Streaming file processing to avoid memory overflow
- Chunked data processing for large CSV files
- Garbage collection optimization for long-running imports
- Resource monitoring and automatic scaling triggers

### Scalability Architecture
- Horizontal scaling support for import workers
- Load balancing for concurrent admin operations
- Caching strategies for import configuration data
- Asynchronous processing with job queue management

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for imported files
- Secure deletion of temporary import files
- Data masking for sensitive information in logs
- Access control validation for all import operations

### Audit & Compliance
- Immutable audit logs for regulatory compliance
- Data lineage tracking from import to final storage
- User action logging with timestamp and IP tracking
- Import rollback capabilities for data correction

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- Built on existing Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- Leverages React + TypeScript frontend architecture
- Integrates with current authentication and RBAC systems
- Designed for microservice extraction in future scaling

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with Supabase functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with row-level security
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage with encryption
- **Queue System**: Redis or PostgreSQL-based job queue
- **Validation**: JSON Schema + custom business rules

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation engine and data transformation
- Integration tests for file upload and processing flows
- Performance tests with large dataset simulations
- Security tests for file upload vulnerabilities

### Monitoring & Observability
- Import success/failure metrics
- Processing time tracking for performance optimization
- Error rate monitoring with alerting
- Resource utilization tracking for scaling decisions

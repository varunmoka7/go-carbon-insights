## Background
With enterprise-scale data imports from multiple sources, administrators need comprehensive real-time monitoring of data quality, health metrics, and system performance. This story creates a mission-critical dashboard that ensures data integrity across 100k+ company profiles and provides early warning systems for data quality issues.

## User Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,
**I want** a real-time data quality monitoring dashboard that tracks data health, validation metrics, and system performance,
**so that** I can proactively identify and resolve data quality issues before they impact users and maintain >95% data accuracy across the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Real-time Data Health Monitoring**
   - Live dashboard showing data quality scores across all datasets
   - Real-time validation status for incoming data streams
   - Automated anomaly detection for unusual data patterns
   - Health status indicators with color-coded alerts (green/yellow/red)

2. **Comprehensive Quality Metrics**
   - Data completeness rates by company, industry, and data type
   - Accuracy scores based on validation rule compliance
   - Consistency metrics across related data fields
   - Timeliness tracking for data freshness and update frequencies

3. **Error Detection & Alerting**
   - Real-time error detection with severity classification
   - Automated alert system via email, Slack, or webhook notifications
   - Error trend analysis and pattern recognition
   - Drill-down capabilities to identify root causes

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Import processing times and throughput metrics
   - Database performance indicators (query times, connection pool status)
   - API response times for data retrieval operations
   - System resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)

5. **Data Lineage & Audit Trails**
   - Visual data flow tracking from source to destination
   - Change history with timestamps and responsible users
   - Data transformation audit logs
   - Impact analysis for data quality issues

6. **Compliance & Reporting**
   - Automated data quality reports for stakeholders
   - SLA compliance tracking for data availability and accuracy
   - Regulatory compliance monitoring for ESG reporting standards
   - Historical trend analysis with configurable time ranges

title: Unified Data Source Management Interface
epic: Epic 2 – Carbon Tracking & Public Platform + Real Data Integration
phase: 2.11
status: completed
completed_date: 2025-07-30

## Background
As the platform integrates multiple data sources (CSV imports, API feeds, future enterprise ESG providers), administrators need a centralized interface to manage, configure, and monitor all data sources from a single location. This story creates a unified management system that provides comprehensive oversight of the entire data ecosystem.

## User Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,
**I want** a unified interface to manage all data sources, their configurations, and integration status,
**so that** I can efficiently oversee the entire data ecosystem, configure new sources, and maintain optimal data flow across 100k+ company profiles from multiple providers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Centralized Data Source Registry**
   - Comprehensive view of all configured data sources (CSV, API, webhook, manual)
   - Source status indicators (active, inactive, error, maintenance)
   - Data source categorization by type, provider, and data category
   - Search and filtering capabilities across all registered sources

2. **Source Configuration Management**
   - Intuitive setup wizard for new data source registration
   - Configuration templates for common data provider types
   - Connection testing and validation for API-based sources
   - Credential management with secure storage and rotation

3. **Data Flow Orchestration**
   - Visual data flow mapping between sources and destinations
   - Dependency management for interconnected data sources
   - Scheduling coordination across multiple import streams
   - Conflict resolution rules for overlapping data sources

4. **Performance & Health Monitoring**
   - Real-time status monitoring for all active data sources
   - Performance metrics (throughput, latency, error rates)
   - Health checks with automated failover capabilities
   - Capacity planning and resource allocation insights

5. **Integration Management**
   - API connection management with rate limiting configuration
   - Webhook endpoint configuration and security settings
   - Data transformation pipeline management
   - Version control for data source configurations

6. **Future-Ready Architecture**
   - Extensible framework for new data provider integrations
   - Standardized connector architecture for enterprise ESG providers
   - Configuration export/import for disaster recovery
   - Multi-environment support (dev, staging, production)

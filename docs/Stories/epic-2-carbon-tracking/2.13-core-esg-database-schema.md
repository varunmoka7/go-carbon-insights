title: Core ESG Database Schema Implementation
epic: Epic 2 – Carbon Tracking & Public Platform + Real Data Integration
phase: 2.13
status: completed
---

## Background
The current platform uses mock data stored in TypeScript files. To support real ESG data from multiple sources, we need a comprehensive database schema that can handle company profiles, emissions data, sustainability targets, and framework compliance across thousands of companies with proper relationships, validation, and performance optimization.

## User Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,
**I want** a robust database schema for ESG metrics that supports real corporate data,
**so that** I can store, query, and manage comprehensive ESG information for 100,000+ companies with proper data integrity, performance, and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Core Company Profiles Table
- **Table:** `companies`
- **Fields:** id, name, sector, industry, headquarters, employees, revenue, market_cap, sustainability_rating, sbti_committed, net_zero_target, created_at, updated_at
- **Constraints:** Unique company names, proper data types, foreign key relationships
- **Indexes:** Performance optimization for name, sector, industry searches
- **RLS:** Row-level security policies for data access control

### 2. Emissions Data Table
- **Table:** `emissions_data`
- **Fields:** id, company_id, year, scope1, scope2, scope3, total_emissions, emissions_intensity, data_source, verification_status, created_at, updated_at
- **Constraints:** Non-negative emissions values, year validation, company relationship
- **Indexes:** Composite indexes for company_id + year, data_source
- **Triggers:** Automatic total_emissions calculation (scope1 + scope2 + scope3)

### 3. SBTi Targets Table
- **Table:** `sbti_targets`
- **Fields:** id, company_id, near_term_target, long_term_target, baseline_year, target_year, validation_status, scope1_reduction, scope3_reduction, created_at, updated_at
- **Constraints:** Valid year ranges, percentage validation (0-100), company relationship
- **Indexes:** Company_id, validation_status, target_year
- **Validation:** Baseline year must be before target year

### 4. Sustainability Frameworks Table
- **Table:** `company_frameworks`
- **Fields:** id, company_id, framework_name, status, score, implementation_date, verification_date, created_at, updated_at
- **Constraints:** Valid framework names, status enum, company relationship
- **Indexes:** Company_id, framework_name, status
- **Enums:** Status (Implemented, In Progress, Planned, Not Started)

### 5. Sustainability Metrics Table
- **Table:** `sustainability_metrics`
- **Fields:** id, company_id, metric_type, value, unit, year, data_source, verification_status, created_at, updated_at
- **Constraints:** Valid metric types, non-negative values, company relationship
- **Indexes:** Company_id, metric_type, year
- **Enums:** Metric types (renewable_energy_percentage, water_usage, waste_generated, carbon_credits, materiality_score)

### 6. Data Quality & Validation
- **Triggers:** Automatic data validation on insert/update
- **Constraints:** Business rule enforcement (emissions consistency, date validation)
- **Audit Trail:** Track all data changes with user and timestamp
- **Data Integrity:** Foreign key constraints and cascading rules

### 7. Performance Optimization
- **Indexes:** Strategic indexing for common query patterns
- **Partitioning:** Year-based partitioning for emissions_data table
- **Materialized Views:** Pre-calculated aggregations for dashboard performance
- **Query Optimization:** Optimized for dashboard and analytics queries

### 8. Security Implementation
- **RLS Policies:** Role-based data access (public read, admin write)
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data encryption at rest
- **Access Control:** Granular permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Logging:** Complete audit trail for data modifications

## Technical Tasks

### Database Schema Creation
- [ ] Create companies table with proper constraints and indexes
- [ ] Create emissions_data table with triggers and validation
- [ ] Create sbti_targets table with business rule validation
- [ ] Create company_frameworks table with enum constraints
- [ ] Create sustainability_metrics table with flexible metric types
- [ ] Implement foreign key relationships and cascading rules

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Design and implement strategic database indexes
- [ ] Create materialized views for dashboard aggregations
- [ ] Implement year-based partitioning for large tables
- [ ] Optimize query patterns for common use cases
- [ ] Set up database monitoring and performance tracking

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Set up role-based access control for all tables
- [ ] Configure audit logging for data modifications
- [ ] Implement data encryption for sensitive fields
- [ ] Create user permission management system

### Data Validation & Integrity
- [ ] Create database triggers for automatic validation
- [ ] Implement business rule constraints
- [ ] Set up data consistency checks
- [ ] Create error handling for constraint violations
- [ ] Implement data quality scoring system

### Migration & Testing
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Set up test data for development environment
- [ ] Implement comprehensive database tests
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for migrations
- [ ] Document schema design decisions and rationale

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All database tables created with proper constraints and relationships
- [ ] Performance indexes implemented and tested
- [ ] RLS policies configured and tested
- [ ] Data validation triggers working correctly
- [ ] Migration scripts tested in development environment
- [ ] Database tests passing with 100% coverage
- [ ] Documentation completed for schema design
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and met
- [ ] Security audit completed and passed

## Success Metrics

- **Data Integrity:** 100% constraint validation success rate
- **Performance:** Dashboard queries complete in <500ms
- **Security:** All RLS policies enforced correctly
- **Scalability:** Schema supports 100,000+ companies efficiently
- **Reliability:** Zero data corruption or integrity issues

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** Epic 1 (Authentication) - For user management and RLS
- **Blocks:** Story 2.14 (Data Transformation Pipeline) - Requires schema foundation
- **Related:** Story 2.9 (Data Import System) - Will use this schema for data storage

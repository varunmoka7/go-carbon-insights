title: Data Transformation Pipeline Implementation
epic: Epic 2 – Carbon Tracking & Public Platform + Real Data Integration
phase: 2.14
status: completed
---

## Background
Currently, the platform has a data import system but lacks the ability to transform raw imported data (CSV, API responses) into structured ESG metrics that can be stored in the database. We need a comprehensive ETL pipeline that can handle various data formats, validate data quality, and transform it into the standardized schema for consistent analysis and reporting.

## User Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,
**I want** an automated data transformation pipeline that processes imported raw data into structured ESG metrics,
**so that** I can efficiently convert various data sources into consistent, validated, and analyzable ESG data for the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. ETL Pipeline Architecture
- **Data Extraction:** Support for CSV, JSON, XML, and API response formats
- **Data Transformation:** Schema mapping, data type conversion, and business logic application
- **Data Loading:** Efficient batch loading into target database tables
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error capture, logging, and recovery mechanisms
- **Monitoring:** Real-time pipeline status and performance metrics

### 2. Data Mapping System
- **Flexible Mapping:** Support for different source formats and field mappings
- **Template System:** Pre-configured mapping templates for common data sources
- **Custom Mappings:** Ability to create custom field mappings for unique data sources
- **Validation Rules:** Configurable validation rules for each data type
- **Transformation Rules:** Business logic for data cleaning and standardization

### 3. Data Validation Engine
- **Type Validation:** Ensure data types match expected schema (numbers, dates, text)
- **Range Validation:** Check values fall within acceptable ranges (non-negative emissions, valid years)
- **Consistency Checks:** Verify data consistency (scope1 + scope2 + scope3 = total)
- **Business Rules:** Enforce domain-specific validation rules
- **Quality Scoring:** Calculate data quality scores based on validation results

### 4. Data Cleaning & Standardization
- **Duplicate Detection:** Identify and handle duplicate records
- **Data Normalization:** Standardize company names, sector classifications, units
- **Missing Data Handling:** Strategies for handling missing or incomplete data
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and flag anomalous data points
- **Data Enrichment:** Add derived fields and calculated metrics

### 5. Batch Processing System
- **Queue Management:** Background job queue for processing large datasets
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress updates for long-running transformations
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for multiple transformation jobs
- **Resource Management:** Memory and CPU optimization for large datasets
- **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed jobs

### 6. Integration with Import System
- **Seamless Integration:** Connect with existing data import system (Story 2.9)
- **Workflow Automation:** Automatic triggering of transformation after successful import
- **Status Synchronization:** Keep import and transformation status in sync
- **Error Propagation:** Proper error handling between import and transformation
- **Audit Trail:** Complete audit trail from import to transformation completion

### 7. Performance & Scalability
- **Streaming Processing:** Memory-efficient processing of large files
- **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threaded transformation for improved performance
- **Caching:** Intelligent caching of frequently accessed transformation rules
- **Resource Optimization:** Efficient use of database connections and memory
- **Scalability:** Support for processing datasets of 100,000+ records

### 8. Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Dashboard for pipeline health and performance
- **Error Tracking:** Detailed error logs with context and resolution suggestions
- **Performance Metrics:** Processing time, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Data Quality Metrics:** Quality scores and validation statistics
- **Alerting:** Automated alerts for pipeline failures or data quality issues

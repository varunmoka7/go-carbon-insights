## Background
The public carbon dashboard serves as the primary interface for users to explore global emissions data, company performance, and industry trends. This dashboard must provide intuitive access to complex ESG data while maintaining excellent performance with 100k+ companies and delivering insights that drive engagement and decision-making.

## User Story
**As a** Public User (Visitor, Investor, Researcher),
**I want** an intuitive and comprehensive carbon dashboard that displays global emissions trends, top performers, and key insights,
**so that** I can quickly understand the current state of corporate climate action and identify companies leading in sustainability performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Global Overview Section**
   - Real-time global emissions counter with trend indicators
   - Top 10 best and worst performing companies by emissions intensity
   - Industry performance heatmap showing relative progress
   - Key statistics cards (total companies tracked, data coverage, last updated)

2. **Interactive Filtering System**
   - Industry/sector dropdown with multi-select capabilities
   - Geographic region filter (continent, country, major markets)
   - Company size filter (market cap, employee count, revenue ranges)
   - Time period selector (last quarter, year, 5-year trends)
   - Emissions scope selector (Scope 1, 2, 3, combined)

3. **Visualization Components**
   - Global emissions trend chart with historical data (5+ years)
   - Industry comparison bar charts showing relative performance
   - Geographic distribution map with country-level aggregations
   - Top companies leaderboard with sortable metrics
   - Progress indicators for SBTi targets and net-zero commitments

4. **Data Quality Indicators**
   - Data freshness timestamps for all displayed information
   - Quality scores shown for each data point with tooltips
   - Coverage indicators showing percentage of companies with verified data
   - Source attribution for all displayed metrics

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Dashboard loads within 3 seconds for initial view
   - Smooth interactions with <500ms response times for filters
   - Progressive loading for detailed views and drill-downs
   - Efficient caching for frequently accessed data

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-optimized layouts with touch-friendly controls
   - Tablet-specific layouts maximizing chart visibility
   - Desktop layouts with multi-column information density
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)

## Performance Considerations (100k Company Scale)

### Data Loading Strategy
- Materialized views for dashboard aggregations refreshed every 15 minutes
- Progressive data loading with skeleton screens for better UX
- Intelligent prefetching of likely next-clicked data
- Client-side caching with cache invalidation strategies

### UI/UX Optimization
- Virtualized rendering for large lists and tables
- Chart data sampling for improved rendering performance
- Debounced filter updates to prevent excessive API calls
- Loading states and error boundaries for robust user experience

### Scalability Architecture
- CDN caching for static dashboard assets and aggregated data
- Edge computing for geographic data distribution
- Database read replicas for dashboard query isolation
- Horizontal scaling for dashboard API endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Public Data Access
- Rate limiting for anonymous users to prevent abuse
- Data sanitization for all public-facing information
- No exposure of sensitive company details or personal information
- Audit logging for unusual usage patterns

### Performance Protection
- DDoS protection through rate limiting and request validation
- Resource monitoring to prevent dashboard overload
- Graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable
- Error handling that doesn't expose internal system details

## Dev Notes

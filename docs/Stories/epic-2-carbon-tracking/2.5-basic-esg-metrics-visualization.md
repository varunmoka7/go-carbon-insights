## Background
ESG data encompasses complex environmental, social, and governance metrics that require clear, intuitive visualization to be meaningful to diverse stakeholders. This story establishes the foundational visualization capabilities that transform raw ESG data into actionable insights through interactive charts, progress indicators, and comparative displays.

## User Story
**As a** Public User (Investor, Analyst, Sustainability Professional),
**I want** comprehensive and intuitive visualizations of ESG metrics including emissions, energy, financial, and governance data,
**so that** I can quickly understand company performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions based on clear visual representations of complex sustainability data.

   - Emissions intensity charts (per revenue, per employee, per unit)
   - Interactive waterfall charts showing emission source contributions
   - Carbon footprint visualization with scope-specific color coding

2. **Financial-Environmental Integration**
   - Revenue vs emissions scatter plots with trend lines
   - Profitability vs sustainability quadrant analysis
   - Cost of carbon metrics and carbon pricing scenarios
   - ROI analysis for sustainability investments
   - Market performance correlation with ESG scores

3. **Progress & Target Tracking**
   - Science-based target progress indicators with milestone tracking
   - Net-zero commitment timelines with intermediate goals
   - Improvement trajectory charts with confidence intervals
   - Benchmark comparison against industry averages
   - Achievement badges and certification status displays

4. **Multi-Metric Dashboard Views**
   - Comprehensive ESG scorecards with weighted scoring
   - Energy mix visualization (renewable vs non-renewable)
   - Water usage and waste generation trend analysis
   - Social metrics display (diversity, safety, employee satisfaction)
   - Governance indicators (board composition, transparency scores)

5. **Interactive Features**
   - Drill-down capabilities from high-level metrics to detailed breakdowns
   - Time range selection for trend analysis (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, all-time)
   - Metric comparison tools for side-by-side analysis
   - Export functionality for charts and data tables
   - Responsive design optimized for mobile and tablet viewing

6. **Data Quality Integration**
   - Visual indicators for data verification status and confidence levels
   - Source attribution for all displayed metrics
   - Data freshness timestamps and update frequency indicators
   - Uncertainty ranges and confidence intervals for estimates
   - Quality score overlays on all visualizations

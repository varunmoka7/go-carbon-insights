## Summary

Fully implemented the user reputation system, dynamic profiles, and badge achievements to gamify community engagement and encourage quality contributions.

## Background

With the core forum structure in place, we need a reputation system to incentivize quality participation and provide users with meaningful progression through the community. This includes dynamic user profiles that showcase achievements and contribution levels.

## Objectives

   - Configurable scoring for different contribution types
   - Transaction-safe reputation updates with rollback support

2. **Badge System**
   - Automated badge awarding based on reputation and actions
   - Category-based organization (reputation, participation, contribution)
   - Achievement tracking and display

3. **Dynamic User Profiles**
   - Real-time reputation display and breakdown
   - Badge showcase with tooltips and categories
   - Profile editing functionality

4. **Interactive Features**
   - Functional upvote/downvote system
   - Optimistic UI updates for responsive interactions

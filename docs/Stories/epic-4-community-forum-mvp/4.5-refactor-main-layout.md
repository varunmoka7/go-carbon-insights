# Story 4.5: Refactor Main Layout to Two-Column View

## Background
As part of the Epic 4 goal to refactor the existing community platform into a simpler, Reddit-style discussion forum, we need to establish a consistent two-column layout that provides better navigation and content discovery.

## User Story
As a user, I want a consistent two-column layout with a persistent sidebar when browsing the community, so that I can easily navigate and discover content.

## Objectives & Scope

   - Main content area for topics and discussions
   - Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

2. **Sidebar Navigation**

   - Category/topic filters
   - Quick navigation links
   - User profile quick access

3. **Main Content Area**
   - Optimized for topic list display
   - Thread view integration
   - Clean, Reddit-style layout

## Implementation Requirements
- Update main Layout component

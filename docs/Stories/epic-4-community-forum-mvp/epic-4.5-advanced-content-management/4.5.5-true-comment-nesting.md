# Story 4.5.5: True Comment Nesting - Implement threaded discussions vs. linear replies

## Background

The current Epic 4 forum implementation uses a linear reply system where all replies are displayed in chronological order. This story transforms the discussion experience by implementing true threaded conversations, allowing users to reply directly to specific comments and creating nested discussion trees that better organize complex conversations.

## User Story

**As a community member**, I want to reply directly to specific comments in a thread, **so that** I can have focused discussions on particular points, follow conversation branches more easily, and contribute to more organized and nuanced community discussions.

## Objectives & Scope

### Primary Objectives
1. **Nested Reply Architecture**: Transform linear replies into hierarchical threaded discussions
2. **Reply-to-Reply Functionality**: Enable users to reply directly to any comment in the thread
3. **Visual Threading**: Implement clear visual indicators showing reply relationships and depth
4. **Conversation Navigation**: Provide intuitive ways to follow and collapse conversation branches
5. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain Epic 4 performance standards with more complex data structures

### Technical Scope
- Redesign reply data structure to support parent-child relationships
- Enhance TopicThreadView to render nested reply trees
- Create new reply components for threaded display
- Implement reply-to-specific-comment functionality
- Add thread collapse/expand controls
- Optimize data fetching for nested structures

## Detailed Requirements

### Frontend Requirements

#### 1. Threaded Reply Architecture
- Transform flat reply list into nested tree structure
- Support unlimited nesting depth with practical UI limits
- Maintain chronological ordering within each nesting level
- Preserve existing reply functionality while adding threading

#### 2. Reply Interface Enhancement
```typescript
interface ThreadedReply extends Reply {
  parent_id: string | null;
  children?: ThreadedReply[];
  depth: number;
  thread_path?: string; // For efficient querying
}

interface ReplyTreeProps {
  replies: ThreadedReply[];
  maxDepth?: number;
  onReply: (parentId: string | null, content: string) => Promise<void>;
  onEdit: (replyId: string, content: string) => Promise<void>;
  onDelete: (replyId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 3. Visual Threading Components
- **ThreadedReplyItem**: Individual reply with nesting indicators
- **ReplyThread**: Container for managing reply branches
- **CollapseToggle**: Expand/collapse controls for long threads
- **ReplyConnector**: Visual lines showing parent-child relationships

#### 4. Reply-to-Reply Interface
```typescript
interface ReplyToReplyProps {
  parentReply: ThreadedReply;
  onSubmit: (content: string) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isSubmitting?: boolean;
}
```

### Backend Requirements

#### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
```sql
-- Update community_replies to support threading
ALTER TABLE community_replies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_id uuid REFERENCES community_replies(id);
ALTER TABLE community_replies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS thread_path text; -- For efficient querying
ALTER TABLE community_replies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS depth integer DEFAULT 0;

-- Create indexes for threading performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_replies_parent_id ON community_replies(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_replies_thread_path ON community_replies(thread_path);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_replies_topic_depth ON community_replies(topic_id, depth);

-- Function to update thread_path and depth
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_reply_thread_path()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.parent_id IS NULL THEN
    -- Top-level reply
    NEW.thread_path = NEW.id::text;
    NEW.depth = 0;
  ELSE
    -- Nested reply
    SELECT thread_path || '/' || NEW.id::text, depth + 1
    INTO NEW.thread_path, NEW.depth
    FROM community_replies
    WHERE id = NEW.parent_id;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger to auto-update thread paths
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_reply_thread_path
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON community_replies
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_reply_thread_path();
```

#### 2. API Enhancements
```typescript
// GET /api/community/topics/:id/replies (enhanced for threading)
interface ThreadedRepliesResponse {
  replies: ThreadedReply[];
  total_count: number;
  thread_count: number;
}

// POST /api/community/replies (enhanced for threading)
interface CreateReplyRequest {
  topic_id: string;
  content: string;
  parent_id?: string; // For threaded replies
}
```

### UI/UX Requirements

#### 1. Visual Threading Design
- **Indentation**: Each nesting level indented by 24-32px
- **Connection Lines**: Subtle vertical lines connecting parent-child replies
- **Depth Limiting**: Maximum visual depth of 6-8 levels to prevent horizontal overflow
- **Collapse Controls**: "[-]" and "[+]" buttons for long reply chains
- **Reply Indicators**: Clear "Reply to [username]" context

#### 2. Threading Controls
- **Reply Button Positioning**: Each reply gets its own "Reply" button
- **Collapse/Expand**: Toggle visibility of reply branches
- **Thread Navigation**: "Jump to parent" and "Show context" options
- **Depth Indicators**: Breadcrumb-style path for deep nested replies

#### 3. Mobile Optimization
- **Reduced Indentation**: Smaller indent increments on mobile (16px)
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: For very deep threads if needed
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriately sized tap targets for controls
- **Simplified Visualization**: Streamlined connection indicators

#### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load only top-level replies initially
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load child replies on demand
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For very long threads if needed
- **Collapse by Default**: Auto-collapse threads beyond certain depth/size

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

#### 1. ThreadedReplyTree Component
```typescript
const ThreadedReplyTree: React.FC<ReplyTreeProps> = ({
  replies,
  maxDepth = 8,
  onReply,
  onEdit,
  onDelete
}) => {
  const [collapsedThreads, setCollapsedThreads] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
  
  const toggleThread = (replyId: string) => {
    setCollapsedThreads(prev => {
      const next = new Set(prev);
      if (next.has(replyId)) {
        next.delete(replyId);
      } else {
        next.add(replyId);
      }
      return next;
    });
  };

  const buildReplyTree = (replies: Reply[]): ThreadedReply[] => {
    const replyMap = new Map<string, ThreadedReply>();
    const rootReplies: ThreadedReply[] = [];

    // First pass: create reply objects
    replies.forEach(reply => {
      replyMap.set(reply.id, {
        ...reply,
        children: [],
        depth: 0
      });
    });

    // Second pass: build tree structure
    replies.forEach(reply => {
      const replyNode = replyMap.get(reply.id)!;
      
      if (reply.parent_id) {
        const parent = replyMap.get(reply.parent_id);
        if (parent) {
          parent.children = parent.children || [];
          parent.children.push(replyNode);
          replyNode.depth = parent.depth + 1;
        }
      } else {
        rootReplies.push(replyNode);
      }
    });

    return rootReplies;
  };

  const threadedReplies = buildReplyTree(replies);

  return (
    <div className="threaded-replies">
      {threadedReplies.map(reply => (
        <ThreadedReplyItem
          key={reply.id}
          reply={reply}
          depth={0}
          maxDepth={maxDepth}
          isCollapsed={collapsedThreads.has(reply.id)}
          onToggleCollapse={() => toggleThread(reply.id)}
          onReply={onReply}
          onEdit={onEdit}
          onDelete={onDelete}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. ThreadedReplyItem Component
```typescript
const ThreadedReplyItem: React.FC<ThreadedReplyItemProps> = ({
  reply,
  depth,
  maxDepth,
  isCollapsed,
  onToggleCollapse,
  onReply,
  onEdit,

}) => {
  const [showReplyForm, setShowReplyForm] = useState(false);
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const { user } = useAuth();

  const hasChildren = reply.children && reply.children.length > 0;
  const shouldShowCollapse = hasChildren && reply.children.length > 2;
  const isDeepNested = depth >= maxDepth;

  const handleReplySubmit = async (content: string) => {
    await onReply(reply.id, content);
    setShowReplyForm(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="threaded-reply-item">

          ))}
        </div>
      )}

            reply={reply}
            onSave={(updates) => onEdit(reply.id, updates.content)}
            onCancel={() => setIsEditing(false)}
          />
        ) : (

        )}

        {/* Reply form */}
        {showReplyForm && (

            placeholder={`Reply to ${reply.author_name}...`}

            variant="link"
            size="sm"
            onClick={() => {/* Open in modal or new view */}}

            Continue this thread ({reply.children!.length} more replies) →
          </Button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Hook Implementation

#### useThreadedReplies Hook
```typescript
export const useThreadedReplies = (topicId: string) => {
  const [replies, setReplies] = useState<Reply[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const fetchReplies = async () => {
    try {
      const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('community_replies')
        .select(`
          id, content, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at,
          parent_id, depth, thread_path, upvotes_count,
          author:auth.users(id, display_name, avatar_url)
        `)
        .eq('topic_id', topicId)
        .order('thread_path', { ascending: true });

      if (error) throw error;
      setReplies(data || []);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const createReply = async (content: string, parentId?: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('community_replies')
      .insert({
        topic_id: topicId,
        content,
        parent_id: parentId,
        author_id: user?.id
      })
      .select(`
        id, content, created_at, parent_id, depth, thread_path,
        author:auth.users(id, display_name, avatar_url)
      `)
      .single();

    if (error) throw error;

    // Optimistically update local state
    setReplies(prev => [...prev, data]);
    
    // Update topic reply count
    await updateTopicReplyCount(topicId, 1);
    
    return data;
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchReplies();
  }, [topicId]);

  return {
    replies,
    loading,
    error,
    createReply,
    // ... other operations
  };
};
```

### Database Query Optimization

#### 1. Efficient Thread Loading
```sql
-- Optimized query for threaded replies with proper ordering
WITH RECURSIVE reply_tree AS (
  -- Base case: top-level replies
  SELECT 
    id, content, created_at, author_id, parent_id, 
    thread_path, depth, 0 as sort_order
  FROM community_replies 
  WHERE topic_id = $1 AND parent_id IS NULL
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Recursive case: child replies
  SELECT 
    r.id, r.content, r.created_at, r.author_id, r.parent_id,
    r.thread_path, r.depth, rt.sort_order + 1
  FROM community_replies r
  JOIN reply_tree rt ON r.parent_id = rt.id
)
SELECT 
  rt.*, u.display_name, u.avatar_url
FROM reply_tree rt
JOIN auth.users u ON rt.author_id = u.id
ORDER BY thread_path;
```

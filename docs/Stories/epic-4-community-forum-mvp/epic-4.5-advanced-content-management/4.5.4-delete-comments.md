# Story 4.5.4: Delete Comments - Allow users to delete their own replies

## Background

Completing the reply lifecycle management started in Story 4.5.3, users need the ability to delete their own replies when content is inappropriate, no longer relevant, or posted in error. This story provides the final piece of user content control while maintaining discussion thread integrity.

## User Story

**As a community member**, I want to delete my own replies, **so that** I can remove content that is incorrect, inappropriate, or no longer contributes meaningfully to the discussion, while preserving the overall conversation context.

## Objectives & Scope

### Primary Objectives
1. **Reply Deletion Interface**: Add delete functionality to reply components
2. **Thread Integrity**: Maintain discussion flow even with deleted replies
3. **Soft Deletion Pattern**: Preserve reply structure for threading consistency
4. **Confirmation Workflow**: Prevent accidental deletions with appropriate safeguards
5. **Context Preservation**: Handle nested replies and threading implications

### Technical Scope
- Enhance reply components with delete functionality
- Create confirmation dialog for reply deletion
- Extend reply hooks with delete operations
- Implement soft deletion for thread integrity
- Add deletion indicators and tombstone display

## Detailed Requirements

### Frontend Requirements

#### 1. Reply Component Enhancement
- Add "Delete" button for reply owners (visible only to reply author)
- Position delete button near edit button
- Implement confirmation workflow appropriate for replies
- Handle post-deletion state and threading updates
- Maintain existing reply performance optimizations

#### 2. Delete Confirmation Strategy
Given the lower impact of reply deletion vs topic deletion, implement a lighter confirmation approach:

```typescript
interface DeleteReplyConfirmationProps {
  reply: Reply;
  onConfirm: () => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isDeleting?: boolean;
  trigger: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Confirmation Options:**
- **Simple Confirmation**: Popover with "Are you sure?" for most cases
- **Modal Confirmation**: For replies with nested children or high engagement
- **Immediate Deletion**: For very recent replies (< 5 minutes, no children)

#### 3. useReplies Hook Extension
```typescript
interface UseRepliesReturn {
  // Existing properties...
  deleteReply: (replyId: string) => Promise<void>;
  isDeletingReply: string | null;
  deleteError: string | null;
}
```

### Backend Requirements

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add deletion tracking to community_replies
ALTER TABLE community_replies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at timestamptz;
ALTER TABLE community_replies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Create view for active (non-deleted) replies  
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_community_replies AS
SELECT * FROM community_replies WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Update RLS policies for reply deletion
CREATE POLICY "Users can soft delete own replies" ON community_replies
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = author_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Index for soft deletion queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_replies_deleted_at 
ON community_replies(deleted_at, topic_id);
```

#### 2. API Endpoint
```typescript
// DELETE /api/community/replies/:id (soft delete)
interface ReplyDeleteResponse {
  id: string;
  deleted_at: string;
  children_count?: number;
  message: string;
}
```

### Soft Deletion Strategy

#### 1. Reply Deletion Behavior
- **Soft Delete**: Mark reply as deleted without removing from database
- **Threading Preservation**: Maintain reply hierarchy for nested discussions
- **Content Replacement**: Show deletion tombstone in place of content
- **Metadata Preservation**: Keep author, timestamp, and threading information
- **Child Reply Handling**: Preserve structure for nested replies

#### 2. Tombstone Display
```typescript
interface ReplyTombstoneProps {
  reply: DeletedReply;
  hasChildren?: boolean;
  depth?: number;
}
```

**Tombstone Features:**
- "[deleted]" message with minimal styling
- Preserved reply hierarchy position
- Author and timestamp information (optional)
- Thread connection for nested replies
- Consistent spacing with active replies

### UI/UX Requirements

#### 1. Delete Button Design
- Subtle trash icon with red hover state
- Positioned consistently with edit button
- Only visible on reply hover
- Disabled state during deletion process
- Appropriate tooltip messaging

#### 2. Confirmation Patterns

**Simple Popover (Default):**
- "Delete this reply?" with Yes/No buttons
- Used for recent replies without children
- Quick, non-disruptive confirmation

**Modal Dialog (Complex Cases):**
- Used for replies with nested children
- Explains impact on nested discussion
- Requires explicit confirmation

**Immediate Deletion (Edge Cases):**
- Very recent replies (< 5 minutes)
- No nested replies or engagement
- Single-click deletion with undo toast

#### 3. Post-Deletion Display
- Subtle "[deleted]" tombstone message
- Preserved reply spacing and threading
- No author information in tombstone
- Children replies remain visible and properly nested
- Loading states during deletion

#### 4. Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly delete controls
- Appropriate confirmation sizing
- Gesture-friendly interaction patterns
- Accessible tombstone display

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

#### 1. Reply Component Updates
```typescript
const ReplyItem: React.FC<ReplyItemProps> = ({ 
  reply, 
  depth = 0, 
  onDelete,
  hasChildren 
}) => {
  const [showConfirm, setShowConfirm] = useState(false);
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  const canDelete = user?.id === reply.author_id && !reply.deleted_at;
  const isRecent = isRecentReply(reply.created_at, 5); // 5 minutes
  const needsConfirmation = hasChildren || !isRecent;

  const handleDeleteClick = () => {
    if (needsConfirmation) {
      setShowConfirm(true);
    } else {
      handleDeleteConfirm();
    }
  };

  const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
    try {
      await onDelete(reply.id);
      setShowConfirm(false);
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handled by hook
    }
  };

  // Show tombstone if deleted
  if (reply.deleted_at) {
    return (
      <ReplyTombstone 
        reply={reply} 
        depth={depth}
        hasChildren={hasChildren}
      />
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="reply-item group">
      <ReplyContent reply={reply} />
      
      {canDelete && (
        <div className="reply-actions">
          <DeleteReplyButton
            onClick={handleDeleteClick}
            needsConfirmation={needsConfirmation}
          />
        </div>
      )}
      
      {needsConfirmation && (
        <DeleteReplyConfirmation
          reply={reply}
          isOpen={showConfirm}
          onConfirm={handleDeleteConfirm}
          onCancel={() => setShowConfirm(false)}
          hasChildren={hasChildren}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. DeleteReplyConfirmation Component
```typescript
const DeleteReplyConfirmation: React.FC<DeleteReplyConfirmationProps> = ({
  reply,
  isOpen,
  onConfirm,
  onCancel,
  hasChildren = false,
  isDeleting = false
}) => {
  return (
    <AlertDialog open={isOpen} onOpenChange={(open) => !open && onCancel()}>
      <AlertDialogContent className="max-w-sm">
        <AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogTitle>Delete Reply</AlertDialogTitle>
          <AlertDialogDescription>
            {hasChildren 
              ? "This reply has responses. Deleting it will keep the responses visible but remove your content."
              : "This reply will be permanently removed from the discussion."
            }
          </AlertDialogDescription>
        </AlertDialogHeader>
        
        <AlertDialogFooter>
          <AlertDialogCancel onClick={onCancel} disabled={isDeleting}>
            Cancel
          </AlertDialogCancel>
          <AlertDialogAction
            onClick={onConfirm}
            disabled={isDeleting}
            className="bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700"
          >
            {isDeleting ? (
              <>
                <Loader2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 animate-spin" />
                Deleting...
              </>
            ) : (
              'Delete Reply'
            )}
          </AlertDialogAction>
        </AlertDialogFooter>
      </AlertDialogContent>
    </AlertDialog>
  );
};
```

#### 3. ReplyTombstone Component
```typescript
const ReplyTombstone: React.FC<ReplyTombstoneProps> = ({
  reply,
  depth = 0,
  hasChildren = false
}) => {
  return (
    <div 
      className="reply-tombstone"
      style={{ marginLeft: `${depth * 24}px` }}
    >
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 py-2 px-3 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded text-sm text-gray-500">
        <MessageSquareX className="w-4 h-4" />
        <span>[deleted]</span>
        {hasChildren && (
          <span className="text-xs">• responses below</span>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Hook Implementation

#### useReplies Hook Extension
```typescript
export const useReplies = (topicId: string) => {
  // Existing implementation...
  const [isDeletingReply, setIsDeletingReply] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [deleteError, setDeleteError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  const deleteReply = async (replyId: string) => {
    setIsDeletingReply(replyId);
    setDeleteError(null);
    
    try {
      // Optimistic update - mark as deleted
      setReplies(prev => prev.map(reply => 
        reply.id === replyId 
          ? { 
              ...reply, 
              deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
              deleted_by: user?.id,
              content: '[deleted]' // For immediate UI update
            }
          : reply
      ));
      
      const { error } = await supabase
        .from('community_replies')
        .update({
          deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
          deleted_by: user?.id
        })
        .eq('id', replyId)
        .eq('author_id', user?.id)
        .is('deleted_at', null);

      if (error) throw error;
      
      // Update topic reply count
      await updateTopicReplyCount(topicId, -1);
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Revert optimistic update
      setReplies(prev => prev.map(reply => 
        reply.id === replyId 
          ? replies.find(r => r.id === replyId) || reply
          : reply
      ));
      setDeleteError(error.message);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      setIsDeletingReply(null);
    }
  };

  return {
    // Existing returns...
    deleteReply,
    isDeletingReply,
    deleteError
  };
};
```

### Database Query Updates

#### 1. Reply Listing with Soft Deletion
```sql
-- Updated reply query to handle deleted replies
SELECT 
  r.id, r.content, r.created_at, r.updated_at, r.deleted_at,
  r.parent_id, r.author_id, r.upvotes_count,
  u.display_name, u.avatar_url,
  CASE WHEN r.deleted_at IS NOT NULL THEN '[deleted]' ELSE r.content END as display_content
FROM community_replies r
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON r.author_id = u.id
WHERE r.topic_id = $1
ORDER BY r.created_at ASC;
```

#### 2. Topic Reply Count Update
```sql
-- Function to update topic reply count excluding deleted
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_topic_reply_count(topic_id uuid)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE community_topics 
  SET replies_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM community_replies 
    WHERE topic_id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL
  )
  WHERE id = $1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

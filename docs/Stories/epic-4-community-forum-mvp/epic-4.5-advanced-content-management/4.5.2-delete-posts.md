# Story 4.5.2: Delete Posts - Allow users to delete their own topics

## Background

Building on Story 4.5.1's edit functionality, users need the ability to delete their own topics when content is no longer relevant, contains errors that can't be fixed, or violates community guidelines. This completes the content ownership model by giving users full control over their topic lifecycle.

## User Story

**As a community member**, I want to delete my own topics, **so that** I can remove content that is no longer accurate, relevant, or appropriate, while maintaining the integrity of ongoing discussions.

## Objectives & Scope

### Primary Objectives
1. **Topic Deletion Interface**: Add delete functionality to TopicThreadView for topic owners
2. **Soft Deletion Pattern**: Implement soft deletion to preserve discussion integrity
3. **Confirmation Workflow**: Prevent accidental deletions with confirmation dialogs
4. **Related Content Handling**: Manage replies and associated data appropriately
5. **Navigation Management**: Handle post-deletion routing and state cleanup

### Technical Scope
- Enhance `TopicThreadView.tsx` with delete functionality
- Create `DeleteTopicConfirmation.tsx` modal component
- Extend `useTopicThread.ts` hook with delete operations
- Implement soft deletion database patterns
- Add deletion indicators and tombstone content display

## Detailed Requirements

### Frontend Requirements

#### 1. TopicThreadView Enhancement
- Add "Delete" button for topic owners (visible only to post author)
- Position delete button near edit button
- Implement confirmation modal workflow
- Handle post-deletion navigation and cleanup
- Maintain existing performance optimizations

#### 2. DeleteTopicConfirmation Component
```typescript
interface DeleteTopicConfirmationProps {
  topic: Topic;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onConfirm: () => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isDeleting?: boolean;
}
```

**Modal Features:**
- Clear warning about deletion consequences
- Topic title and metadata display for confirmation
- Explanation of soft deletion (content marked as deleted)
- Confirmation requirement (typing "DELETE" or checkbox)
- Prominent cancel and delete buttons

#### 3. useTopicThread Hook Extension
```typescript
interface UseTopicThreadReturn {
  // Existing properties...
  deleteTopic: (topicId: string) => Promise<void>;
  isDeleting: boolean;
  deleteError: string | null;
}
```

### Backend Requirements

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add deletion tracking to community_topics
ALTER TABLE community_topics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at timestamptz;
ALTER TABLE community_topics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE community_topics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deletion_reason text;

-- Create view for active (non-deleted) topics
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_community_topics AS
SELECT * FROM community_topics WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Update RLS policies for soft deletion
CREATE POLICY "Users can soft delete own topics" ON community_topics
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = author_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);
```

#### 2. API Endpoint
```typescript
// DELETE /api/community/topics/:id (soft delete)
interface TopicDeleteRequest {
  reason?: string; // Optional deletion reason
}

interface TopicDeleteResponse {
  id: string;
  deleted_at: string;
  message: string;
}
```

### Soft Deletion Strategy

#### 1. Topic Deletion Behavior
- **Soft Delete**: Mark topic as deleted without removing from database
- **Content Preservation**: Original content remains for moderation/audit
- **Reply Handling**: Associated replies remain but show deletion context
- **Search Exclusion**: Deleted topics excluded from search results
- **URL Handling**: Deleted topic URLs show tombstone message

#### 2. Tombstone Display
For deleted topics accessed directly:
```typescript
interface TombstoneProps {
  topic: DeletedTopic;
  canRestore?: boolean; // Future admin feature
}
```

**Tombstone Features:**
- "This topic has been deleted" message
- Deletion timestamp and author information
- Preserved topic metadata (title, category, author)
- Related replies count with option to view
- Navigation back to community

### UI/UX Requirements

#### 1. Delete Button Design
- Red color scheme indicating destructive action
- Trash icon with "Delete" label
- Positioned after edit button in action group
- Disabled state during deletion process
- Tooltip explaining deletion behavior

#### 2. Confirmation Modal Design
- Clear, prominent warning about deletion
- Topic context (title, creation date, reply count)
- Explanation of soft deletion consequences
- Required confirmation action (checkbox or text input)
- Distinct cancel and delete buttons
- Loading state during deletion

#### 3. Post-Deletion Handling
- Success toast notification
- Automatic navigation to community home
- Topic list updates removing deleted item
- Breadcrumb updates reflecting navigation
- Browser history management

#### 4. Tombstone Display
- Professional "content deleted" message
- Minimal topic metadata preservation
- Clear navigation options
- Consistent styling with forum theme
- Mobile-responsive design

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

#### 1. TopicThreadView.tsx Updates
```typescript
const TopicThreadView: React.FC<TopicThreadViewProps> = ({ topicId }) => {
  const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
  const { topic, deleteTopic, isDeleting, deleteError } = useTopicThread(topicId);
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const canDelete = user?.id === topic?.author_id && !topic?.deleted_at;

  const handleDeleteClick = () => setShowDeleteConfirm(true);
  const handleDeleteCancel = () => setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
  
  const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
    try {
      await deleteTopic(topicId);
      setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
      navigate('/community', { 
        state: { message: 'Topic deleted successfully' }
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handled by hook
    }
  };

  // Show tombstone if topic is deleted
  if (topic?.deleted_at) {
    return <TopicTombstone topic={topic} />;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Topic content */}
      {canDelete && (
        <div className="topic-actions">
          <Button onClick={handleDeleteClick} variant="destructive">
            <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
            Delete
          </Button>
        </div>
      )}
      
      <DeleteTopicConfirmation
        topic={topic}
        isOpen={showDeleteConfirm}
        onConfirm={handleDeleteConfirm}
        onCancel={handleDeleteCancel}
        isDeleting={isDeleting}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. DeleteTopicConfirmation.tsx Component
```typescript
const DeleteTopicConfirmation: React.FC<DeleteTopicConfirmationProps> = ({
  topic,
  isOpen,
  onConfirm,
  onCancel,
  isDeleting = false
}) => {
  const [confirmText, setConfirmText] = useState('');
  const [hasConfirmed, setHasConfirmed] = useState(false);
  
  const canDelete = confirmText === 'DELETE' || hasConfirmed;

  return (
    <Dialog open={isOpen} onOpenChange={(open) => !open && onCancel()}>
      <DialogContent className="max-w-md">
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle className="text-red-600">Delete Topic</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>
            This action cannot be undone. The topic will be permanently removed.
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-3 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-medium">{topic.title}</h4>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
              Created {formatDate(topic.created_at)} • {topic.replies_count} replies
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Label>Type "DELETE" to confirm:</Label>
            <Input
              value={confirmText}
              onChange={(e) => setConfirmText(e.target.value)}
              placeholder="DELETE"
              disabled={isDeleting}
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button variant="outline" onClick={onCancel} disabled={isDeleting}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button
            variant="destructive"
            onClick={onConfirm}
            disabled={!canDelete || isDeleting}
          >
            {isDeleting ? (
              <>
                <Loader2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 animate-spin" />
                Deleting...
              </>
            ) : (
              'Delete Topic'
            )}
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
```

### Hook Implementation

#### useTopicThread.ts Extension
```typescript
export const useTopicThread = (topicId: string) => {
  // Existing implementation...
  const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
  const [deleteError, setDeleteError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  const deleteTopic = async (id: string) => {
    setIsDeleting(true);
    setDeleteError(null);
    
    try {
      const { error } = await supabase
        .from('community_topics')
        .update({
          deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
          deleted_by: user?.id
        })
        .eq('id', id)
        .eq('author_id', user?.id) // Ensure ownership
        .is('deleted_at', null); // Prevent double deletion

      if (error) throw error;
      
      // Update local state
      setTopic(prev => prev ? { 
        ...prev, 
        deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        deleted_by: user?.id 
      } : null);
      
    } catch (error) {
      setDeleteError(error.message);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      setIsDeleting(false);
    }
  };

  return {
    // Existing returns...
    deleteTopic,
    isDeleting,
    deleteError
  };
};
```

### Database Queries

#### 1. Topic List Filtering
```sql
-- Update topic list queries to exclude deleted topics
SELECT t.*, u.display_name, u.avatar_url, c.name as category_name
FROM community_topics t
JOIN auth.users u ON t.author_id = u.id
JOIN community_categories c ON t.category_id = c.id
WHERE t.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

#### 2. Tombstone Data
```sql
-- Query for deleted topic tombstone display
SELECT 
  id, title, author_id, category_id, created_at, 
  deleted_at, replies_count,
  u.display_name as author_name,
  c.name as category_name
FROM community_topics t
JOIN auth.users u ON t.author_id = u.id
JOIN community_categories c ON t.category_id = c.id
WHERE t.id = $1 AND t.deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

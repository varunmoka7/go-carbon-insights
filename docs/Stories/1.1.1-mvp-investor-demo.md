### Story 1.1.1: MVP Investor Demo Account

#### User Story

As an **investor or potential partner**, I want **to easily access a pre-configured demo account**, so that **I can explore the GoCarbonTracker platform's features without any friction.**

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new user is created in Supabase with the email `demo@gocarbontracker.net` and password `demodemo`.
2.  The user is assigned a "demo" role with restricted, non-admin permissions.
3.  The demo account is populated with a realistic set of isolated, read-only example data.
4.  A "Login as Demo" button on the login page autofills the credentials.
5.  A persistent banner is displayed after logging in, explaining the account's limitations (e.g., "You are in a read-only demo environment. Data is for illustrative purposes only.").
6.  The `README.md` file is updated with the demo credentials and a brief explanation.
7.  All relevant project documents that track epics and stories are updated to include Epic 1.1. New files are created under a `/docs/epics/` directory if needed for better organization.

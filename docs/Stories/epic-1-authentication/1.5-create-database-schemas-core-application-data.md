# Story 1.5: Create Database Schemas for Core Application Data

## Story Overview
**As a Platform Administrator, I want all the necessary Supabase database tables for emissions, targets, and public company data to be created, so that the application has a structured backend to store and retrieve data.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ An `emission_records` table is created.
2. ✅ Tables for `emission_targets` and `progress` are created.
3. ✅ Tables for `public_company_profiles`, `public_emissions_data`, and `industry_benchmarks` are created.
4. ✅ All necessary relationships, foreign keys, and initial RLS policies are configured.

## Implementation Status
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Technical Implementation

### Database Migration
- **Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250718180000_create_core_application_data.sql`
- **Created**: 2025-07-18
- **Description**: Creates the core application data tables for emissions tracking, targets, progress, and public company data

### Tables Created

#### 1. `emission_records` Table
**Purpose**: Store all emission records for both private tracking and public data

**Key Features**:
- Links to users (`user_id`) and companies (`company_id`)
- Comprehensive emission data (Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions)
- Calculated `total_emissions` column
- Data quality and verification tracking
- Additional metrics (energy consumption, renewable energy, waste, water)
- Public/private visibility control
- Comprehensive metadata and audit trail

#### 2. `emission_targets` Table
**Purpose**: Store climate targets for companies and users

**Key Features**:
- Support for multiple target types (absolute, intensity, renewable energy, net zero)
- Flexible target scopes (scope 1, 2, 3, or combinations)
- Baseline and target values with progress calculation
- Automatic progress percentage calculation via computed column
- Target status tracking (active, achieved, revised, abandoned)
- Public/private visibility control

#### 3. `progress` Table
**Purpose**: Track detailed progress against targets over time

**Key Features**:
- Links to targets via `target_id`
- Time-series progress tracking
- Automatic target current value updates via triggers
- Data source tracking

#### 4. `public_company_profiles` Table
**Purpose**: Store publicly available company information for benchmarking

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive company identification (name, ticker, industry)
- Financial metrics (market cap, revenue, employees)
- Sustainability framework tracking
- Science-based targets and net-zero commitments
- Data quality scoring

#### 5. `public_emissions_data` Table
**Purpose**: Store publicly available emissions data for companies

**Key Features**:
- Links to company profiles
- Complete emission data (Scope 1, 2, 3)
- Intensity metrics (revenue and employee-based)
- Additional sustainability metrics
- Verification status tracking
- Data source attribution

#### 6. `industry_benchmarks` Table
**Purpose**: Store industry-level benchmark data for comparison

**Key Features**:
- Industry classification system
- Multiple statistical measures (average, median, percentiles, best/worst in class)
- Sample size tracking
- Year-over-year benchmark evolution

### Security Implementation

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with comprehensive policies:

**Private Data Access**:
- Users can only access their own emission records and targets
- Users can view public records and targets
- Full CRUD operations for owned data

**Public Data Access**:
- All authenticated users can view public company data
- Controlled access for managing public data (admin functionality)

**Progress Data Access**:
- Users can only access progress for their own targets
- Users can view progress for public targets

### Performance Optimization

#### Indexes Created
- User and company relationship indexes
- Time-based indexes for reporting periods
- Industry and sector indexes for benchmarking
- Public data visibility indexes

#### Computed Columns
- `total_emissions` automatically calculated from scope emissions
- `progress_percentage` automatically calculated from baseline, target, and current values

#### Triggers
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Automatic target current value updates from progress entries

### Data Quality Features

#### Validation Constraints
- Data quality scores (1-5 scale)
- Verification status enumeration
- Target type and scope validation
- Percentage range validation

#### Audit Trail
- Created and updated timestamps on all tables
- Data source tracking
- User attribution for all records

## Database Schema Relationships

```
auth.users (Supabase)
├── profiles (1:1)
│   └── companies (N:1)
├── emission_records (1:N)
│   └── companies (N:1)
├── emission_targets (1:N)
│   ├── companies (N:1)
│   └── progress (1:N)

public_company_profiles (1:N)
└── public_emissions_data (1:N)

industry_benchmarks (standalone)
```

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- Tables support both private tracking and public data exploration
- Proper user context handling via RLS policies
- Optimized for filtering, sorting, and pagination

### Analytics Integration
- Computed columns for common calculations
- Benchmark comparison capabilities
- Progress tracking over time

### Data Import/Export
- Flexible schema supports CSV import/export
- Data quality scoring for imported data
- Bulk operations support

## Testing Considerations

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Check constraints validate data ranges
- Triggers maintain data consistency

### Security Testing
- RLS policies tested for data isolation
- User context properly enforced
- Public data access controls verified

### Performance Testing
- Indexes optimized for common query patterns
- Computed columns reduce calculation overhead
- Efficient relationship traversal

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- Additional emission categories (Scope 4, biogenic)
- More granular industry classification
- Advanced benchmarking metrics
- Integration with external data sources

### Scalability Considerations
- Table partitioning for large datasets
- Archival strategies for historical data
- Caching for frequently accessed benchmarks

## Story Completion

This story has been successfully implemented and meets all acceptance criteria:

1. ✅ **emission_records table created** - Comprehensive emission tracking with data quality features
2. ✅ **emission_targets and progress tables created** - Target setting and progress tracking with automatic calculations
3. ✅ **Public company data tables created** - Complete benchmarking infrastructure
4. ✅ **Relationships and RLS policies configured** - Secure, efficient data access patterns

The database schema provides a solid foundation for:
- Private emission tracking
- Public data exploration
- Target setting and progress monitoring
- Industry benchmarking
- Data quality management
- Scalable growth

**Epic 1 is now 100% complete** with all foundational backend and authentication components implemented.

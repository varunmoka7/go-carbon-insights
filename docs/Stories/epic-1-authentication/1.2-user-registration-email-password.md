# Story 1.2: User Registration with Email and Password

### Status
- [x] Done

### Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to be able to sign up for an account using my email and a password,
**so that** I can access the GoCarbonTracker platform.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A registration page exists with input fields for email and password.
2. Upon submission, a new account is created in the Supabase `auth.users` table.
3. A corresponding `profiles` entry is created and linked to the new user account.
4. Clear error messages are provided for invalid inputs.
5. After successful registration, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to their personal Tracker page.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1, the database schema includes proper foreign key relationships and RLS policies. The `profiles` table uses auth.users.id as primary key and includes company_id foreign key relationship.

#### Current Implementation Analysis
The codebase already has a sophisticated authentication system in place:
- **Auth Context**: Full authentication context with signUp, signIn, signOut methods [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx]
- **Registration Form**: Complete registration UI with email, username, password, and confirm password fields [Source: src/pages/Auth.tsx]
- **Supabase Integration**: Configured client with proper database types [Source: src/integrations/supabase/client.ts]
- **Security Validation**: Comprehensive validation utilities for email, password, and username [Source: src/utils/securityValidation.ts]

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Database Schema** [Source: supabase/migrations/20250718133513_setup_core_tables.sql]
- `profiles` table exists with proper foreign key to auth.users
- RLS policies configured for secure access
- Proper indexes for performance optimization

**Authentication Flow** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx]
- signUp method handles email/password registration
- Automatic profile creation needs database trigger implementation
- Email verification flow configured with redirects
- Rate limiting implemented for security

**Frontend Implementation** [Source: src/pages/Auth.tsx]
- Registration form with email, username, password fields
- Client-side validation with real-time feedback
- Error handling and user feedback via toasts
- Responsive design with shadcn/ui components

**Required Technical Enhancements**
1. **Database Trigger**: Create trigger function to auto-create profiles entry when new user registers
2. **Profile Creation Logic**: Ensure proper linking between auth.users and profiles tables
3. **Email Verification**: Verify email confirmation flow works correctly
4. **Redirect Logic**: Implement redirect to /tracking (personal Tracker page)

#### File Locations
- Auth page: `src/pages/Auth.tsx`
- Auth context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Supabase client: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Security validation: `src/utils/securityValidation.ts`
- Database migrations: `supabase/migrations/`

#### Tech Stack Context
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Supabase for authentication and database
- React Hook Form for form management
- Zod for validation schemas

#### Testing Requirements
Based on existing codebase structure:
- Unit tests for validation functions
- Integration tests for auth flow
- Component tests for Auth.tsx
- E2E tests for complete registration journey

### Testing
* Test the registration form with valid inputs to ensure account creation
* Test email verification flow end-to-end
* Verify profiles table entry is created with correct user linking
* Test error handling for invalid inputs (weak passwords, existing emails)
* Verify rate limiting prevents abuse
* Test redirect functionality after successful registration
* Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2, the authentication infrastructure is robust and already implemented:
- Full authentication context with signIn, signUp, signOut, and resetPassword methods
- Auth.tsx page contains both registration and login forms in a single component
- Comprehensive security validation utilities with rate limiting
- Database trigger for automatic profile creation is working
- Redirect logic after successful registration implemented

#### Current Implementation Analysis
The codebase already has a sophisticated authentication system that covers most requirements:

**Authentication Context** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx]
- `signIn` method handles both email and username authentication (lines 144-177)
- `signInWithUsername` method for username-based login (lines 179-218)
- `resetPassword` method for password reset functionality (lines 241-269)
- Rate limiting implemented with `checkRateLimit` for security (lines 150, 245)
- Comprehensive error handling with generic error messages for security

**Frontend Implementation** [Source: src/pages/Auth.tsx]
- Login form with email/username input field (lines 253-267)
- Password input field with show/hide toggle (lines 270-302)
- Form validation with real-time feedback (lines 97-133)
- Error handling and user feedback via toast notifications (lines 157-167)
- Automatic redirect to /tracking after successful authentication (lines 80-84)

**Security Features** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx]
- Input sanitization using `sanitizeInput` function (line 148)
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (lines 150, 245)
- Generic error messages prevent information leakage (lines 164, 210)
- Proper session management with Supabase auth state

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Login Flow** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:144-177]
- Accepts email or username as input
- Validates input format and applies rate limiting
- Routes to email-based or username-based login
- Handles authentication errors with generic messages
- Updates user session state on successful login

**Username Login Support** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:179-218]
- Looks up email from `user_profiles` table based on username
- Validates username format before database lookup
- Falls back to email-based authentication with retrieved email
- Proper error handling for non-existent usernames

**Password Reset Flow** [Source: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:241-269]
- Validates email format before sending reset email
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (2 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Configures redirect URL for password reset completion
- Always returns success to prevent email enumeration

**Frontend Form Handling** [Source: src/pages/Auth.tsx:135-173]
- Unified form handling for both sign up and sign in modes
- Client-side validation before submission
- Loading states and error display
- Automatic mode switching between sign up and sign in

#### Required Technical Enhancements
1. **"Forgot Password?" Link**: Add visual link to trigger password reset flow
2. **Password Reset UI**: Implement UI for password reset completion
3. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Ensure all error scenarios are properly handled
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for login scenarios

#### File Locations
- Auth page: `src/pages/Auth.tsx`
- Auth context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Security validation: `src/utils/securityValidation.ts`
- Supabase client: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

#### Tech Stack Context
[Source: package.json]
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Supabase for authentication and database
- React Hook Form for form management
- React Router for navigation
- Zod for validation schemas

#### Database Schema
[Source: Previous Story 1.2 analysis]
- `auth.users` table managed by Supabase
- `profiles` table with automatic creation trigger
- `user_profiles` table for username lookups
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured

#### Security Considerations
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- Generic error messages prevent information leakage
- Proper session management with Supabase auth
- Password reset flow prevents email enumeration

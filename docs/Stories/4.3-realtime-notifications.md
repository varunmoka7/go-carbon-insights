## Background
While our SSE-based dashboard works well for admin metrics, forum users and moderators need true bidirectional, low-latency updates for topics, replies, reports, and moderation actions. This story covers the server-side setup, client integration, security, scalability, testing, fallback, and documentation in one go.

## Objectives & Scope
1. **WebSocket Infrastructure & Security**  
   - Integrate Socket.IO on `/ws` (or native `ws`) in `forum-service`  
   - JWT handshake and per-event re-validation  
   - Rate-limit socket events (e.g. max 10/sec per socket)  
   - Fallback to existing SSE endpoint if WS fails  
2. **Event Contracts & Namespacing**  
   - Standardize event names:  
     - `topic:created`, `reply:created`, `report:created`, `moderation:action`  
   - Define payload interfaces (e.g. `TopicCreatedPayload` with minimal metadata)  
   - `/forum` namespace for user streams, `/admin` for future WS-based dashboard  
   - Room support: `topic:<id>`, `category:<id>`  
3. **Client Integration & Fallback**  
   - React hook `useWebSocket()` in `frontend/forum` that:  
     - Authenticates, joins rooms based on route  
     - Shows toasts and updates lists on incoming events  
     - Switches to SSE if WS connection fails  
4. **Scalability & Redis Adapter**  
   - Config via `.env` (`WS_ADAPTER=redis`, `REDIS_URL=…`)  
   - Use `socket.io-redis` (or `@socket.io/redis-adapter`) for pub/sub in multi-instance  
   - Graceful degradation when Redis is down  
5. **Testing & QA**  
   - **Unit**: handshake auth, room join/leave, each event emitter  
   - **Integration**: in-memory server + mock Redis adapter; two clients in same room receive each other's events  
   - **Error cases**: invalid JWT, rate-limit breaches  
6. **Documentation**  
   - New `docs/api/websocket.md` with payload schemas and example snippets  
   - Update `README.md` with WS setup, `.env` flags, and fallback notes  
   - Client-side example in `frontend/forum/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Server**  
  - `/ws` endpoint accepts JWT connections and emits the four event types on create/update  
  - Proper namespacing and room functionality  
  - Rate-limit enforced, SSE fallback available  
- **Client**  
  - `useWebSocket()` hook connects, subscribes, shows toasts, and falls back to SSE  
  - Works in topics list and single-topic views  
- **Scalability**  
  - Redis adapter wired up and tested in multi-instance mode  
- **Tests & Docs**  
  - All unit and integration tests pass  
  - Documentation is complete and examples run as-described

# AI Agent Ideas & Brainstorming for GoCarbonTracker

This living document captures ideas, strategies, and plans for integrating AI agents into the GoCarbonTracker platform, both for development and as interactive features for users. Add new thoughts, sketches, or plans here as the project evolves.

## Vision: Agentic Community & Development

### 1. AI Agents as Virtual Community Members

#### a. Virtual Users / Forum Participants
- Simulate active community engagement, seed discussions, and keep forums lively.
- Deploy AI agents with different personas (e.g., “Sustainability Expert,” “Data Analyst,” “New User”) who can:
  - Start new threads on trending topics.
  - Reply to user questions with helpful, context-aware answers.
  - Ask clarifying questions to encourage deeper discussion.
  - Welcome new users and guide them to resources.

#### b. Specialist Agents for Each Topic
- Provide expert-level answers and moderation in specific forum categories (e.g., “Scope 3 Emissions,” “Data Quality,” “Decarbonization Strategies”).
- Assign an AI agent to each major topic or category, trained or prompted with domain-specific knowledge. These agents can:
  - Answer technical questions.
  - Curate and highlight the best community answers.
  - Summarize long threads for newcomers.

#### c. Interactive Q&A and Resolution Agents
- Ensure every user question gets a timely, high-quality response.
- Use an “AnswerBot” agent that:
  - Monitors unanswered questions.
  - Provides initial answers or tags the right specialist agent.
  - Follows up to check if the user’s issue is resolved.
  - Escalates complex issues to human moderators if needed.

## 2. AI Agents for Community Health and Moderation

- **Moderation Agent:** Detects spam, inappropriate content, or off-topic posts and takes action or flags for review.
- **Sentiment Analysis Agent:** Monitors community mood, flags negative trends, and suggests interventions.
- **Onboarding Agent:** Greets new users, offers a tour, and suggests first actions.

## 3. AI Agents for Content Generation and Curation

- **Content Summarizer:** Summarizes long threads or hot topics into digestible highlights.
- **Resource Recommender:** Suggests relevant articles, datasets, or tools based on the discussion.
- **Event Organizer:** Proposes and helps coordinate community events, AMAs, or webinars.

## 4. Technical Integration Ideas

- **BMAD Orchestration:** Use BMAD’s agentic planning to design, test, and iterate on these agents’ behaviors and roles.
- **API Integration:** Expose agent actions via API endpoints so your React frontend can interact with them in real time.
- **User Experience:** Clearly label AI-generated content and allow users to “ask an expert” or “summon a specialist” with a button.
- **Feedback Loop:** Let users rate AI answers, which can be used to retrain or re-prompt agents for better performance.

## 5. Example User Flows

- **User posts a question about Scope 3 emissions.**
  - “Scope 3 Specialist” agent replies with a detailed answer and links to resources.
  - “AnswerBot” follows up in 24 hours to check if the user needs more help.
  - If the user is satisfied, the thread is marked as resolved; if not, the agent escalates to a human moderator.

- **A new user joins the forum.**
  - “Onboarding Agent” sends a welcome message, suggests topics to follow, and offers a quick-start guide.

- **A heated debate starts.**
  - “Sentiment Analysis Agent” detects rising negativity and suggests a moderator intervene or posts a calming message.

## 6. Next Steps

1. Define Agent Roles
2. Design Prompts/Behaviors
3. Integrate with BMAD
4. Frontend Integration
5. Monitor and Iterate

## 7. Open Questions for Brainstorming

- What level of autonomy should agents have (e.g., can they start threads, or only reply)?
- How will you handle transparency (clearly marking AI vs. human posts)?
- Should users be able to “subscribe” to certain agents or topics?
- How will you ensure the accuracy and safety of AI-generated content?

# GoCarbonTracker Pre-Seed Pitch Deck

**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Pre-seed funding presentation

---

## Slide 1: Problem

### The Carbon Accounting Crisis
**Enterprise climate compliance is broken:**

üî¥ **Data Fragmentation Crisis**
- Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions scattered across 15+ systems
- Manual data collection takes 6-8 months per reporting cycle
- 73% of companies struggle with data quality & completeness

üî¥ **Compliance Complexity Explosion** 
- New regulations: CSRD, TCFD, SBTi targets mandate detailed reporting
- $2.3B spent annually on carbon consultants just for basic compliance
- 89% of companies fear regulatory penalties for inadequate reporting

üî¥ **The "Data Selling" Problem**
- Current solutions sell data but abandon companies post-purchase
- No actionable decarbonization guidance - just expensive dashboards
- Companies still don't know HOW to reduce emissions

**Result:** Companies spend millions on carbon accounting but remain stuck in reporting hell with no clear path to actual decarbonization.

## Slide 2: Solution
